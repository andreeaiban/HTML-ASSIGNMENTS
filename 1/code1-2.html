        <h1>Revelation</h1>
        <h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
        <p>We make ourselves a place apart<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Behind light words that tease and flout,<br />
        But oh, the agitated heart<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Till someone find us really out.</p>

        <p>'Tis pity if the case require<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;(Or so we say) that in the end<br />
        We speak the literal to inspire<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The understanding of a friend.</p>
        
        <p>But so with all, from babes that play<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;At hide-and-seek to God afar,<br />
        So all who hide too well away<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Must speak and tell us there they are.</p>
